# XFSC fixture package

Stand-ins for the XFSC credential services (issuer, wallet, verification, status list) so the
journeys in [Scenario decisions](../../../docs/scenarios.md) can be built and tested before the live
services are available. Everything here is synthetic and marked `"fixture": true`; a result built on
it is reported as **fixture-only**, never as live evidence.

## Layout

One file per operation and case: `<operation>/<case>.json`.

| Operation | `allow` | `deny` | `unavailable` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `issue` | `participant-reader` receives its credential | nothing issued to `participant-unpresented` | issuer unreachable |
| `present` | presentation answering the verifier's challenge | presentation with the wrong challenge | wallet unreachable |
| `verify` | IF-03 outcome `verified` | IF-03 outcome `revoked`, `CRED-REVOKED` | verification service unreachable |
| `status` | status list with the reader's bit clear | status list with the reader's bit set | status list unreachable |

Each file has the same members: `fixture`, `operation`, `case`, `input`, `output` (the artefact, or
`error` for an unavailable service) and `expect` (what the demonstrator must do with it).

## Formats

- **Credentials and presentations** follow the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model 2.0. They carry
  no proof: how the live issuer secures them is not confirmed yet, and the fixtures do not guess it.
- **Status lists** follow W3C Bitstring Status List: 131 072 entries, GZIP-compressed,
  base64url-encoded with the multibase prefix `u`. The reader's credential is at index 42; the
  `deny` list has exactly that bit set.
- **Verification outcomes** are IF-03 payloads and validate against
  `docs/contracts/if03-verification-outcome.v1.schema.json`. Reason codes are from
  `docs/contracts/reason-codes.json`.

## Swapping to the live services

Each operation is replaced on its own, by configuration: point the adapter at the live endpoint and
keep the same `expect` as the acceptance check. What the swap still needs, per operation:

| Operation | Needed from the live service |
|---|---|
| `issue` | Issuer endpoint and version; the credential format and how it is secured |
| `present` | Wallet endpoint and the presentation request it accepts |
| `verify` | Verification endpoint and signing key (`kid`) for IF-03 outcomes |
| `status` | Status list URL and its update behaviour |

## Open points

- **No reason code for an unreachable verifier or status list.** The behaviour is fixed — fail
  closed, no token issued — but the registry has no `CRED` code for it. Adding one is a change to
  the reason-code registry.
- **No IF-01 source for the issuer.** Issuance events cannot be shown on the feed until IF-01 gains
  a source for it.
